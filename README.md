# BlanketsMvc
Date: 17/02/2023

First and foremost, I downloaded Visual Studio and.NET 3.1. 
After that, configure HTTPS and include individual account authentication for the 'Blankets' project. 
Then, as I begin the assignment in VS, create a GitHub repository to backup my application.
After that, I used the provided Controller-View-Model materials to create the About Us page in the View. 
I included information about the fictional company's name, 'Blankets,' corporate offices, employees, and general product description, 'Blankets,' in that.
I then changed the title of the page to match the name of my fictional company 'Blankets'. 
Then, using the file'style.css' I created a customised one by adding product photos, changing the default design, presenting specific colour preferences, and even font.
I also included a photo of my 'Blanket' product.
I added a File called 'SeedData.cs' to the Model file. 
I also used Nudget Packages to migrate data. I also helped the Controller with scaffolding. 
I entered the 10 values for all six types of properties of my given product in the SeedData.cs file.
Finally, I added a new field called 'Rating' and performed migration.
